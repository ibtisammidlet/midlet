##phelsofy  
-OOP  
-used what you know until know what you need  
-just-in-time: software need to be up as fast as possible, if you would make chat-GPT into google search integaration, then no conditioning for google captcha, and never will be.  
-focus on what i entertaning to you in the moment. (not always works)  
-code organizing is the standards, organize when you make, try to use natrual variables (eg file names) as data storing.  
-focues on point of failer in your productivity, what consumb most time, is it opening the editor? (auto bat opening will implemented)  
-organizin is time depandant, what made now will be sort by now, and the rest after it.  
-use fastest what you know as you can, use python when you need a downloader (yt-dl) , js projects will be waste of search.  
-always stay under 100k, we don't work for money.  
-free or expensive, choose
